## Commands

- `hello`: command for starting the day. It has to print both a 'hello' string (including day, time and other stuff) and the list of to-do things.
- `bye`: day ends. A brief report is printed containing the total amount of hours, the tasks (both completed or pending, so the completed ones can be marked).
- `pause`: it stops the timer.
- `resume`: it restarts the timer and prints the pending tasks for the day.
- `<task_name>:`: command for inputting a previous done task (the task ends when the command is used and starts from the last command done). *The task number can be also used.*
- `:<task_name>`: command for inputting a task that will be done immediately (time starts when the command is used and ends when another task is input or when there is a pause or a bye.)
- `note`: command for adding a note to the current task.
- `current`: command for printing the current task, the elapsed time and the related notes (if there are)
